I built this simple single page app to showcase some of the current popular front-end technologies including:

<ul>
<li>AngularJS</li>
<li>Jasmine for unit testing</li
<li>MongoDB hosted on MongoLab for persistence store</li
<li>NodeJS (server file located at scripts/webs-server.js)</li
</ul>

The app is based on the <a href='https://github.com/angular/angular-seed'> Angular Seed project </a>.
