I built this simple single page app to showcase some of the current popular front-end technologies including:

AngularJS
Jasmine for unit testing
MongoDB hosted on MongoLab for persistence store
NodeJS (server file located at scripts/webs-server.js)

The app is based on the <a href='https://github.com/angular/angular-seed'> Angular Seed project </a>.
